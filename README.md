* Popular and latest tab
* Order by recently updated and user rating
* Categories
* Tags
* Keywords

## How to install

There are two ways of installing the extension:

### Install using Tachiyomi repo [Recommended]

This is the recommended way. Whenever the extension is updated, Tachiyomi will automatically fetch the newest version.

You can add the extension as an external repo by going to `More` -> `Setings` -> `Browse` -> `Extension repos`. Tap the `Add` button and fill in the following into the field:

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Corruptex/tachiyomi-yiffer-extension/repo/index.min.json`

This is a branch that's inside this repository, which is provides the format that Tachiyomi wants to access the extension repo. When the `.apk` is updated inside the `apk` directory, you'll get an update in the Tachiyomi app.

### Install using the APK

You can download the APK for this extension in the `Releases` tab on GitHub. Download the APK, execute it and it should prompt for Tachiyomi to install it.

For more information about both methods of installing, you can check out [Tachiyomi's official documentation](https://tachiyomi.org/docs/guides/getting-started) about it.
